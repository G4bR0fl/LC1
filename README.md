# Computational Logic 1
Final project from Computational Logic 1 - 2018/1
## Project
 Proof part of Ford Johnson sorting algorithm *(merge-insertion sort)* utilizing the proof assistant [PVS](http://pvs.csl.sri.com/)

## Project tasks:
To be added

### Useful PVS Commands:

1. `Alt + x → tc`  Verifies if the syntax of the file is correct *(type check)*.
2. `Alt + x → cc`  Shows current context and then put the path where the original file is *(change context)*.
3. `Alt + x → reset-pvs`  Resets pvs in an efficient way.
4. `Alt + x → prove-theory`  Asks which theorem that's wanted to be proved. And then just put the theorem's name.
